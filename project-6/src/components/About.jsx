        <p>Solo Leveling is a Korean web novel and webtoon series created by Chu-Gong, originally serialized on Papyrus starting November 4, 2016, and later adapted into a webtoon on KakaoPage beginning April 13, 2018.
            The story follows Sung Jin-Woo, a weak and underappreciated Hunter in a world where trans-dimensional portals known as "Gates" appear, allowing monsters to enter and threatening humanity.
            Hunters, individuals with magical abilities, enter these dungeons to defeat monsters and protect society, with their strength ranked hierarchically.
            Jin-Woo, initially ranked as the weakest Hunter, survives a near-fatal double dungeon raid where his entire team is wiped out.
            In that moment, he is chosen by a mysterious program called "the System," which grants him the rare ability to level up in strength independently, a phenomenon referred to as "solo leveling".
